Protect the Queen! Welcome to BUZZ 🐝 OFF, the 2-player game of spelling bees!

In this game, players command a colony of bees (letters) who make words to seek-and-destroy a rival Queen -- the letter 'Q'. 

Each turn, players move four honeycomb spaces around the hive -- one bee may move all four spaces, or the moves may be split up.

When a bee attacks an opponent's bee, they have a BUZZ-OFF, where both players must spell their best word using the letter they attacked or defended with, plus a pool of six communal letters. Additionally, if a player has other bees bordering their opponent's BUZZ-OFF bee on any side, those letters ('Support Bees') are added to that player's pool of spellable letters.

Words are scored by the sum of their letters' point values (found on the bottom of each bee). The player with the lower-scoring word loses their BUZZ-OFF bee, which is removed from the game, but does not lose any 'Support Bees'. In the case of a tied score, the longer word wins -- in the case of a 2nd tie, the defender wins.

When a bee reaches the back row of their opponent's side, players have the option to convert that letter to blank (0 point value).

Players' letters are not visible to their opponent until their bee is in a BUZZ-OFF -- after the BUZZ-OFF, the winning bee's letter is visible for the remainder of the game.

Once a player successfully defeats their opponent's 'Q' in a BUZZ-OFF, the Queen is vanquished and the game is over!

CONTROLS: To move a bee, single-click on it, then single-click again on the desired move space. (Bees cannot swap/jump spaces)
